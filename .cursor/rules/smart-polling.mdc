# smart-polling

The smart polling system implements adaptive request frequency based on user activity states:

### Core Polling Logic
- Located in `apps/web/src/components/providers/smart-polling-provider.tsx`
- Implements three distinct polling intervals:
  - Active: 15 seconds (when user is actively engaged)
  - Inactive: 60 seconds (when user is idle)
  - Background: 120 seconds (when app is minimized/backgrounded)

### Activity State Management
- Located in `apps/web/src/hooks/use-smart-polling.ts`
- Tracks user activity through:
  - Document visibility state
  - Window focus events
  - User interaction timestamps
- Dynamically adjusts polling frequency based on detected state changes

### Integration Points
The polling provider exposes context values consumed by application components to:
- Access current polling interval
- Monitor activity state changes
- Override default intervals when needed
- Trigger manual poll requests

Importance Score: 85 - Critical for optimizing server load while maintaining data freshness based on actual usage patterns
