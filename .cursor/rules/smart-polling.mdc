# Smart Polling

The smart polling system implements dynamic polling interval adjustments based on user activity states through a React context provider.

## Core Components

### Smart Polling Provider
**File Path:** `/apps/web/src/components/providers/smart-polling-provider.tsx`

Manages activity state and polling intervals with three distinct modes:
- Active: Default polling mode during user interaction
- Inactive: Reduced polling frequency when user is idle
- Background: Minimal polling when tab/window is not focused

### Smart Polling Hook
**File Path:** `/apps/web/src/hooks/use-smart-polling.ts`

Exposes polling configuration and state management:
- Activity state tracking
- Interval adjustment logic
- Integration with React Query operations

## State Management

Activity states determine polling behavior:
1. Active State: Normal application interaction
2. Inactive State: No user activity detected
3. Background State: Browser tab/window not focused

## Interval Calculations

Polling intervals are dynamically adjusted based on:
- Current activity state
- Time since last user interaction
- Browser visibility state
- Custom thresholds per feature

## Activity Detection

Monitors user activity through:
- Mouse movements
- Keyboard interactions 
- Focus/blur events
- Visibility change events
