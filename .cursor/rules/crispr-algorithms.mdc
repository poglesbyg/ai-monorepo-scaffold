# crispr-algorithms

The CRISPR algorithms implementation focuses on guide RNA design and validation:

### Guide RNA Design Core (Importance: 95)
Location: `apps/web/src/lib/crispr/guide-design.ts`

Key algorithms for CRISPR guide RNA design:
- GC content percentage calculation for target sequences
- PAM site identification in forward/reverse DNA strands 
- Generation of 20bp guide RNA sequences adjacent to PAM sites
- Scoring mechanism for guide RNA efficiency and specificity
- Filtering logic for optimal guide selection

### Sequence Input Processing (Importance: 85)
Location: `apps/web/src/components/crispr/sequence-input.tsx`

Handles DNA sequence validation and preprocessing:
- Input sanitization for valid DNA sequences
- Identification of sequence patterns
- Conversion between forward/reverse complement sequences
- PAM site highlighting and visualization

### Results Analysis (Importance: 80)  
Location: `apps/web/src/components/crispr/guide-results-table.tsx`

Guide RNA results processing:
- Ranking and sorting of candidate guides
- Efficiency score calculation
- Display of relevant sequence characteristics
- Filtering interface for guide selection
