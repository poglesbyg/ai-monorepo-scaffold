### Database Schema Design (Importance: 95)
The project implements domain-specific data models through Kysely, focusing on:

1. Core Schema Location: `packages/db/src/schema`
2. Type Definitions: `packages/db/src/types.ts`
3. Column Type Specifications: `packages/db/src/column-types.ts`

### Authentication Data Models (Importance: 90)
Integration with better-auth requires specific schema structures:

1. User Sessions
- Handles OAuth token storage
- Manages session persistence
- Located in `packages/db/src/types.gen.ts`

2. User Profiles
- Stores GitHub OAuth provider information
- Custom timezone settings with IANA validation
- Located in `packages/api/src/routers/user.ts`

### Domain-Specific Models (Importance: 85)

CRISPR Guide RNA Data:
- Schema supports guide RNA design data
- Stores sequence information and PAM sites
- Maintains efficiency scores and GC content calculations
- Located in `packages/db/src/types.ts`

### Query Utilities (Importance: 75)

Custom database helpers in `packages/db/src/utils.ts`:
- Type-safe query builders
- Domain-specific filtering patterns
- Integration with tRPC procedures
