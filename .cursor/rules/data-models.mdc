## Core Database Schema

### Experiment Data Model
- Customized schema for CRISPR experiments tracking:
  - Sequences and guide RNAs
  - Off-target sites
  - Experimental metadata
  - DNA sequence validation (ATCGN pattern)

File path: `/db/migrations/*`
Importance: 95

### Guide RNA Data Model
- Stores guide RNA information:
  - Efficiency and specificity scores (0-1 range)
  - Target sequence data
  - On/off-target predictions
  - Associated experimental metadata

File path: `/packages/db/src/types.ts`
Importance: 90

### Sequence Analysis Model
- Captures AI-generated analysis results:
  - GC content analysis
  - Quality assessment scores
  - Optimization suggestions
  - Sequence transformations

File path: `/packages/db/src/column-types.ts`
Importance: 85

### User Authentication Model
- Manages user data and authentication:
  - Role-based access control
  - Session management
  - OAuth integration data
  - User preferences

File path: `/packages/db/src/db.ts`
Importance: 75

### Data Relationships
- Experiment to Guide RNA: One-to-many
- Guide RNA to Off-target Sites: One-to-many
- Users to Experiments: Many-to-many
- Sequences to Analysis Results: One-to-one

File path: `/packages/db/src/types.gen.ts`
Importance: 80
